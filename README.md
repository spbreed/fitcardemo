$ mean init <myApp>
$ cd <myApp> && npm install
```

### Invoke node with a task manager
Mean supports the gulp task runner for various services which are applied on the code.
To start you application run -
```bash
$ gulp
```

Alternatively, when not using `gulp` (and for production environments) you can run:
```bash
$ node server
```
Then, open a browser and go to:
```bash
http://localhost:3000
```

```bash
sudo rm -R .git/
git clone https://github.com/spbreed/fitcar.git
mv fitcardemo/.git/ .
